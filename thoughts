no doubt, behind every successful man there is a women
but, behind a very very successful man, there is a reason, small, contended, but perfectly powerful and thats one sided love:
behind every very very successful man , there is a GIRL, who didnt even knows that she was(and is in my case) so so so special
for someone, who could have just anything to make her smile and feel proud of him
PITY .... i feel for those, who doesn't cares for the eyes who turn out bright seeing them.
all they need is one chance to prove themselves. and in a matter of time after having a so much of ignorance. all there is left
with them is the only feeling :she would be seeing me doing good, i just hope she tips off to someone that she used to know me!
